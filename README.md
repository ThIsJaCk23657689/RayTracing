# Ray Tracing

This program just for fun. I'm trying to write the perfect code for ray tracing. 
Maybe I can learn more fantasy things in this program.

#### !! NO LIBRARIES !!
Only C++17 and CMake, let's all.

#### support multi-threading.
generate 1920x1080 image, 100 samples per pixel, and 50 depth, it takes about 5 minute.
